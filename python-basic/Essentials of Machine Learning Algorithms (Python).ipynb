    "**How it works**: This algorithm consists of a target/outcome variable (or dependent variable) which is to be predicted from a given set of predictors (independent varibales). Using these set of variables we generate a function thatmap inputs to desired outputs. The training process continues until the model achieves a desired level of accuracy on training data.\n",

    "\n",
    "LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree based learning algorithms. It is designed to be distributed and efficient with the following advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Faster training speed and higher efficiency\n",
    "Lower memory usage\n",
    "Better accuracy\n",
    "Parallel and GPU learning supported\n",
    "Capable of handling large-scale data\n",
    "The framework is a fast and high-performance gradient boosting one based on decision tree algorithms, used for ranking, classification and many other machine learning tasks. It was developed under the Distributed Machine Learning Toolkit Project of Microsoft.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the LightGBM is based on decision tree algorithms, it splits the tree leaf wise with the best fit whereas other boosting algorithms split the tree depth wise or level wise rather than leaf-wise. So when growing on the same leaf in Light GBM, the leaf-wise algorithm can reduce more loss than the level-wise algorithm and hence results in much better accuracy which can rarely be achieved by any of the existing boosting algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it is surprisingly very fast, hence the word ‘Light’.\n",
    "\n",

    "CatBoost is a recently open-sourced machine learning algorithm from Yandex. It can easily integrate with deep learning frameworks like Google’s TensorFlow and Apple’s Core ML.\n",
